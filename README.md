## Overview

### Signals and patterns of fine dust data

Don't you think we're approaching natural phenomena with too much scientific way? This project starts from the perspective of looking at fine dust phenomena as signals from nature. In this way, fine dust data is converted into binary signals and expressed as visual and auditory elements through web technology. Through this, the user spends time contemplating finding the pattern of fine dust through the eyes and ears. Finally, I hope that the user will recognize that different signals are occurring for each data and discover what messages nature is delivering.
